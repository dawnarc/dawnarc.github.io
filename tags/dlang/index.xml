      <description>原文：What does C++ do better than D?
https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/97207/what-does-c-do-better-than-d
Most of the things C++ &amp;ldquo;does&amp;rdquo; better than D are meta things:
C++ has better compilers, better tools, more mature libraries, more bindings, more experts, more tutorials etc. Basically it has more and better of all the external things that you would expect from a more mature language. This is inarguable.
As for the language itself, there are a few things that C++ does better than D in my opinion.</description>

  Optimizing C++ takes time! (The other lines are all at the bottom) Compilers (all on Windows):
 VC++ 2013 x64 without (/Od) and with optimizations (/O2) Go 1.7.1 amd64 without (-gcflags -N -l) and with optimizations (no flags) Rust 1.12.0 MSVCx64 without (-C opt-level=0) and with optimizations (-C opt-level=2) DMD32 D 2.071.2 x64 without (no flags) and with optimizations (-O) Free Pascal 3.0.0 i386 without (-O-) and with optimizations (-O2)  The source codes being compiled are the same simplistically generated programs with an increasing number of functions of about 5-20 lines each.</description>

First things first:
 You did ask this in a Rust community, so I might be biased, but I will try to be as fair as I can. This of course are my personal opinions, people have different preferences so it is hard to say black-and-white that this is good and this is bad. Take it as “this might be true, I will take this into consideration and research these points and then build on that”.</description>
