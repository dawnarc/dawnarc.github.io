First things first:
 You did ask this in a Rust community, so I might be biased, but I will try to be as fair as I can. This of course are my personal opinions, people have different preferences so it is hard to say black-and-white that this is good and this is bad. Take it as “this might be true, I will take this into consideration and research these points and then build on that”.</description>
